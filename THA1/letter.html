<h4>Subject: Devsnest 30-days program for student welfare</h4>
<p>Dear Mr Manoj Goel,</p>
<blockquote>This letter is to inform you about the devsnest's 30 day training program.
      This program helps the students to learn in a responsive environment where they can 
      grow individualy as well as a group. The program includes some of the best handpicked
      questions that have been asked in FANG interviews and other companies as well. The program
      focuses on a strong DSA foundation and also provides a development environment for the students to make
     mistakes and learn together. Please schedule a meeting so that we can take the talk further.</p>
   
   <p>Hoping for your positive response.</p> </blockquote><br>
<p>
Your sincerely,<br>
Shrey Sinha <br>
Devsnest-Team Leader
